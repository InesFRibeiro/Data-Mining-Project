### Description   

This project is about an insurance company that operates in Portugal.
The goal is to develop a Customer Segmentation based on a database of 10.290 customers.

With this Customer Segmentation, the company will be able to improve their performance. 

The segmentation allows us, not only to choose which kinds of customers to target (maybe there are some groups of customers that are not worth doing any marketing campaign because they do not resonate with the company message/values) but also to actually do different marketing campaigns for each different cluster/group of customers. This could potentially increase the company profits.
During this project, the data was worked in a way that would be beneficial for the cluster analysis and later, the customer segmentation.

The final cluster solution, was achieved through a merge between a Value and a Consumptions perspectives, and resulted in 4 different clusters of customers. A marketing campaign/gameplan was suggested to try to get the most out of the campaigns that the company has.
